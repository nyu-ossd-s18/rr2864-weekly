# Bitcoin Team

Members:
- Rokney Rosemie
- Juan Jimenez
- Alvaro Luken Luna
- Wentao Zou

## Team
Three of our members familiar with python, which is needed for us to write test for the project.

There's barely any documentation in the code base, but sadly because a majority of bitcoin is none of us know C++ 
(but we do know C...), and having such a large code base to work off of.

## Milestones:
1. Become familiar with the code base - _Resources like their IRC or Slack will be helpful. I don't think Bitcoin's
community is the type to want to answer a noobies question, but you can piece together a understanding of the code 
by watching to convosations._
2. Writing python tests
3. Contribute to github discussions
4. Review and confirm pull request
5. Solve an issue and offer a pull request

### Wikipideda Article
[White lighter myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_lighter_myth&diff=prev&oldid=828616441)

While trying to find some information on the white lighter myth and the 27 Club I came across a broken link to a artist named Jack Dow. There isn't a Jack Dow in the 27 club yet alone a popular musican named Jack Dow, so I removed the mention of 'Jack Dow' from the article

# A personal email to Richard Stallman

I was curious of Richard Stallman's drug usage. He makes no memtion of any usage on his website, where he talks about everything. I didn't encrypt the message but I hope he replies.
