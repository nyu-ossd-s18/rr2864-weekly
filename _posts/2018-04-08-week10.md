## Google's Approach to Open Source

_n u l l   v o i d_

I wasn't able to attend the talk with Danna Kelmer on this week. I have my own bias towards Google when it comes to them working and devloping free and open source software. While stuff like Chromium and android which I use regualery are great, these softwares are extremly hard to work on. In the case of android, it being open source is primarily for other manurtrures to use and run their own version of android rather then have users work on it for their own needs.
