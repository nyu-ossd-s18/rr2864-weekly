## What I Learned

## What I Wish I Had Learned
Important or popular open source projects. It would have been interesting to see FOSS/HFOSS and open projects
across the world. It would have been interesting to see the good that open source technology has provided.

## What I Would Remove from the Class
Weekly blog posts, mostly because I'm a horrible student and cant get stuff done in time. 
I would'nt mind the weekly blog post if we had readings or more assigments to go along with them. Writing a post about 
an topic we went over class isn't interesting.

Also exams are pointless in this class, papers would be a better evaluation on our knownledge of open source.

## What I Would Add to the Class
More discussions on the open philopshy. An important part of open source for me is the values. I know it's a 
computer science class but it would be nice to have class discussions in general.
