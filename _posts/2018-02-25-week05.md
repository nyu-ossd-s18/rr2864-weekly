# FOSS projects I would work on!
I try to personally try to use Free/Open source software, so working on a project that I use would be interesting.
Also humanitarian and open data projects would be pretty cool to work on outside of things I personally use. 

The code base is also important. I would preffer to work on projects written in a languege that I currently use like
python or javascript, but I wouldn't mind learning another langauge like Rust.

I really want to work on a desktop applications. It's something I've been wanting to get into for a while, but by 
looking at repos for applications I use, it seems to be on the difficult side of things.

## My Strengths
I have experience with working collbartively with people on git. I also run GNU/Linux on my main machine, so it would
be handy for bug testing on a different environment. Also I have a pretty strong web development background.

## Hopes
Really hope I can work on something other then web development and learn how to document better. Documentation is 
pretty helpful when working on a project with others and yourself.

## Worries
Other than finding a project that I'm interested in is dead, I don't have any worries about finding a FOSS project.
