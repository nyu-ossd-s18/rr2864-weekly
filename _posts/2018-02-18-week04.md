# Class site bug fixes!

The bug fixes was pretty simple because the issue was a grammer typo and the orginal poster provide the correction and a floowing user replied with the page location for the typo. Once I made a fork of the class site on github I cloned it using `git clone git@github.com:rantahu/cs480_s18.git` on my termial. `vim cs480_s18/syllabus.markdown' open up the file and then removed the extra s from `licenses`. Once saved `git commit -am 'Fixed typo' and I `git push'. Now I make a pull request on github. I have a odd habbit of merging the changes from the master repo so I can solve any merge issues myself so someone else doesn't have too, but it was pretty pointless to do that now because there still a lot of pull request coming after me that could could cause a conflict if not accepted in order.
