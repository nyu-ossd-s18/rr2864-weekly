# Contributing to Wikipedia
The random page feature on Wikipedia is a great way to for users to find grammer issues, missing information, 
and broken links for articles accross their site. While scrolling through the random pages I 
came across the article for Kothrud, a suburb of Pune, India. The article had a few missing/broken
links which where easy fixes. I just did some research on the locations and tried to find a proper
website because there's no wiki articles on them.
