## What is Open Source?
When I think of open source I think of freedom. Sounds pretty corny, but I love the fact my computer is no longer a magic box. Just being able to see how my software is built. Especially when it comes to education. Having to the ability to look around and learning how you system works without the need to  seek formal education. 

One advantage and disadvantage of open source is security. Because the code is accessible to anyone. Any bugs in the software could be reported in and/or fixed by someone in the community or be used for harm before anyone notices the hole.

## Projects I Use
Debian – The currently running on my the laptop. I use to dual boot my system with windows but decided to just have Linux running. I’m using i3-gaps for my window manager and have been working on my rice for a while now. 

Atom – My favorite text editor, mainly because of the UX design. 

GIMP – While I prefer Adobe Photo and do have the creative suite, I tend to use GIMP way more often  just because my laptop runs Linux. Most of my creative work is done on my desktop which runs windows.

LibreOffice – Hate using this. I only use this for quick notes and drafts. I guess should I added the fixes I want, but it’s just easier to go on my browser and use Google Drive.

## Speaker Questions 

“What OS do you currently use? Why did you choose it? Have you made any modifications?“

“2018, year of the Linux desktop?”
